## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Callbacks for `onStick` and `onUnstick` events, which are triggered when an element becomes sticky or unsticky
- Support for scrolling sticky elements, when they are higher than the viewport height
- Code to disconnect the `mutationObserver` to prevent potential issues with sticky
  elements, which are made unsticky

### Changed

- Reduced calls to `.css` by passing an object with multiple properties instead of
  calling `.css` multiple times for each property where possible

  elements are present on the same page
- Use template literals instead of concatenation where possible
